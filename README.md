# U2L13 Code Along - DALL-E POST Requests

This code along uses an async function to generate images with OpenAI's DALL-E API. By creating a `POST` request, we send prompts to the API and receive AI-generated images based on these prompts. 

**API Key**: You can find the key in your GChat messages or by visiting OpenAIâ€™s platform.
